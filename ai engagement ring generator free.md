## Creating the Perfect Ring Design: Understanding the Parameters

To get the most out of Shakker AI's engagement ring generator, you need to understand the key elements that make up a beautiful ring design. Here's what you should include in your prompts:

### Diamond Shapes

The cut of the diamond dramatically influences the overall look of the ring:

- **Round**: The classic choice with maximum brilliance and fire
- **Princess**: Square-shaped with contemporary angles
- **Emerald**: Rectangular with step-cut facets for a sleek, elegant look
- **Cushion**: Square with rounded corners for a vintage feel
- **Oval**: Elongates the finger with its extended shape
- **Pear**: Teardrop shape combining the best of marquise and oval cuts
- **Marquise**: Elongated with pointed ends for a dramatic look
- **Radiant**: Combines the elegance of emerald cut with the brilliance of round
- **Asscher**: Octagonal with step-cut facets and cropped corners

### Metal Types

The choice of metal affects both aesthetics and durability:

- **White Gold**: Modern and versatile, complements most diamond colors
- **Yellow Gold**: Traditional and warm, contrasts beautifully with diamonds
- **Rose Gold**: Romantic with a pink hue, increasingly popular
- **Platinum**: Premium choice with natural white luster, extremely durable
- **Silver**: Budget-friendly with a bright shine (though less common for engagement rings)

### Setting Styles

The setting determines how the diamond is secured and presented:

- **Solitaire**: Single stone with minimal metal, highlighting the diamond
- **Halo**: Center stone surrounded by smaller diamonds for added sparkle
- **Pavé**: Band lined with tiny diamonds for continuous sparkle
- **Channel**: Diamonds set flush within the band for a sleek look
- **Three-stone**: Center stone flanked by two smaller stones, often symbolizing past, present and future
- **Bezel**: Metal rim surrounds the diamond for a contemporary, secure look
- **Cathedral**: Arches of metal elevate the center stone for a majestic look
- **Tension**: Diamond appears suspended between two sides of the band

- **Side stones**: Smaller diamonds or gemstones alongside the center stone
- **Filigree**: Delicate metalwork for vintage appeal
- **Engraving**: Patterns or text etched into the band
- **Split shank**: Band divides as it approaches the center stone
