# Squish AI Magic: The Best Way to Turn Everything into Addictive Squish Videos

Squish AI is an innovative AI template available on Tensor Art that transforms your static images into captivating 5-second videos with a popular "squish" effect. This effect, which compresses and distorts objects in your image in a humorous, attention-grabbing way, has become a massive trend across TikTok and other social platforms.

The tool uses AI technology to automatically generate this effect without requiring any complex video editing skills, making it accessible to everyone from beginners to content creators looking to boost engagement.

## Cost & Credits

Each time you use Squish AI, it costs **21 credits**. With a free account, you receive **100 credits daily**, allowing you to create approximately 3-4 squish videos per day.

A significant advantage of this tool is that your created videos **remain private**, unlike some other paid tools that make your content publicly visibleâ€”perfect for those concerned about privacy or creating content for commercial use.

## Need More Credits?

If you want to create more than 3-4 squish videos daily, there are several options to purchase additional credits:

* **Monthly Pro Subscription**: $9.90 for 1,000 credits
* **Quarterly Pro Subscription**: $19.90 for 5,000 credits
* **Annual Pro Subscription**: $59.90 for 25,000 credits (50% off the original price of $119.90)
* **Credit Packages**: Available in 3,000 or 10,000 credit bundles, without requiring a subscription

## Pro Tips for Creating Viral Squish Videos

1. **Choose Distinctive Objects**: Images with clear, prominent subjects work best for the squish effect
2. **Experiment with Different Modes**: Each mode creates a slightly different squish style
3. **Use High-Resolution Images**: Better input quality means better output quality
4. **Focus on Facial Expressions**: Animals, people with expressive faces, or objects with "face-like" features often create the most amusing results
5. **Keep It Short**: The 5-second format is perfect for social media attention spans

## Why Squish AI Stands Out

This tool strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and quality. With the free daily credits, you can experiment without commitment, while the private output protects your content. The simple interface makes it easy for anyone to create professional-looking squish videos in seconds, no matter your technical skill level.
